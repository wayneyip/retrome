## Overview
RetroMe is a character creator in which you build your own avatar in pixel art!

Pick your favorite features and outfits from elf ears to edgy black jackets, or randomly generate it all with the click of a button.
Color your features any way you want, from blue eyes and auburn hair to green skin and blond eyebrows -- and if nothing fits your bill, parse in your own colors!
Finally, save your avatar straight to your local drive as a clean PNG image ready for use.
